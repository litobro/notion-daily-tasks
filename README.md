# notion-daily-tasks
[Notion.so](https://www.notion.so) is an online workspace and productivity management software. It is a powerful tool that utilizes relational database style structures to customize your dashboards. 

Unfortunately, there is limited support for automations and other routines. In particular, the creation of items in a database periodically is not supported. This may be useful when users want to create something like a daily routine task list that resets every day. 

This project intends to create a relatively simple system to automate the creation of daily tasks. It uses the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/reference) as implemented in (notion-py)[https://pypi.org/project/notion/].
